# Local Development

## Prerequisites

- .NET 8.0 SDK
- Azure AI Foundry resource  
- Microsoft 365 tenant with SharePoint
- Azure App Registration fully configured

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/microsoft/agent-with-sharepoint-knowledge
   cd agent-with-sharepoint-knowledge
   ```

2. **Configure Azure App Registration**

   1. **Create an Azure App Registration**:
      - Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
      - Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** → **App registrations**  
      - Click **New registration**
      - Name: your app name
      - Supported account types: **Accounts in this organizational directory only (Single tenant)**
      - Redirect URI: **Web** platform with `https://localhost:5001/signin-oidc`
      - Click **Register**

   2. **Configure Authentication**:
      - Go to **Authentication** in the left menu
      - Under **Platform configurations**:
        - Ensure **Web** platform is configured with redirect URI: `https://localhost:5001/signin-oidc`
        - Add logout URL: `https://localhost:5001/signout-callback-oidc`
        - Enable **ID tokens** under Implicit grant and hybrid flows

   3. **Configure API Permissions**:
      - Go to **API permissions** → **Add a permission** → **Microsoft Graph** → **Delegated permissions**
      - Add these permissions:
        - `Files.Read.All`
        - `Sites.Read.All`
        - `Mail.Send`
        - `User.Read`
      - For Azure AD authentication for Azure AI Foundry, also add:
        - Go to **Add a permission** → **APIs my organization uses**
        - Search for "Microsoft Cognitive Services" or use the Application ID: `7d312290-28c8-473c-a0ed-8e53749b6d6d`
        - Select **Delegated permissions** → `user_impersonation`
      - **Important**: Grant admin consent for all permissions to enable seamless token acquisition
      - Click **Grant admin consent** for all permissions

3. **Upload sample files to your SharePoint site**
   1. Create a SharePoint site if you don't already have one. Keep the site URL handy to paste in the application settings in the next step.

   2. Upload the files from the /Sample data folder to your SharePoint site.

4. **Configure Application Settings**

   1. Copy the example configuration:

      ```bash
      cp appsettings.example.json appsettings.json
      ```

   2. Update `appsettings.json` with your values:

      ```json
      {
         "AzureAd": {
           "TenantId": "your-tenant-id",
           "ClientId": "your-client-id"
         },
         "AzureAIFoundry": {
           "ProjectEndpoint": "your-azure-ai-inference-endpoint",
           "ModelName": "your-model-name"
         },
         "Microsoft365": {
           "TenantId": "your-tenant-id",
           "ClientId": "your-client-id",
           "FilterExpression": "path:\"https://your-sharepoint-site.sharepoint.com\""
         }
      }
      ```
   3. **Runtime Secret Creation**
      This process is automatic and only applies for local development.
      
      1. **Ensure Your Account Has Permissions**:
         - Log in through `azd auth login` with an account that has permissions to create secrets for the app configured in your `appsettings.json`'s `AzureAd:ClientId`

      2. **Run the Application**:
         ```bash
         dotnet run
         ```

         The application will automatically:
         - Check if a client secret exists in configuration
         - Get your current user ID from Microsoft Graph
         - Clean up any existing secrets created by you (same user ID)
         - Create a new user-specific secret with format: `{user-guid}-Auto-Generated-{date}` (expires in 24 hours)
         - Configure it for the current session

      3. **Verify Operation**:
         - Check the console output during startup for secret creation and cleanup messages
         - The application will automatically handle user-specific secret management

5. **Setup Access for Azure AI Foundry**
   You can skip this if you deployed your app via `azd up` as access to Foundry is granted through Managed Identities.

   In Local Development, users need to be individually granted access to the 
   1. Go to your Azure AI Foundry project in https://ai.azure.com/
   2. Go to **Management Center** at the bottom
   3. Under **All Resources** select your project
   4. Under **Resource** > **Users** click the **+ New User**
   5. Add all the users that will use your app to access this Foundry resource as an **Azure AI User**

6. **Run Locally**

   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   dotnet restore

   # Build the application
   dotnet build

   # Run the application
   dotnet run
   ```

   The application will be available at:
   - HTTP: `http://localhost:5000`
   - HTTPS: `https://localhost:5001`

## Azure Developer CLI Deployment

```bash
# Initialize environment
azd init

# Provision and deploy
azd up
```

After running the azd commands above you will be presented with the URL to the deployed container app. Add the following redirect URIs to the same app registration mentioned above:

- `https://{your-container-app-url}/signin-oidc`
- `https://{your-container-app-url}/signout-callback-oidc`
